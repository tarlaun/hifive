/**
 * An accumulator that computes the MBR of a dataset, the number of features, and its total size.
 * Keep in mind the following points:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is the responsibility of the caller to use the accumulator correctly. It should be used either in
 * an action, or in a transformation that gets applies.</li>
 * <li>If applied in a transformation, the accumulator might be applied multiple times. This will affect the
 * [[Summary#numFeatures]] and [[Summary#size]] values but the MBR will be accurate if applied many times.
 * From Spark's documentation:
 * <li>For accumulator updates performed inside actions only, Spark guarantees that each task’s update to the
 * accumulator will only be applied once, i.e. restarted tasks will not update the value. In transformations,
 * users should be aware of that each task’s update may be applied more than once if tasks or job stages are
 * re-executed.</li>
 * <li>If an accurate result is vital, use one of the methods [[computeForFeatures()]]
 * or [[computeForFeaturesWithOutputSize()]] instead.</li>
 * </ul>
