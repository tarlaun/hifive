  /**
   * This tag may be used to store the GeoKey Directory, which defines and references
   * the "GeoKeys", as described below.
   * The tag is an array of unsigned SHORT values, which are primarily grouped into
   * blocks of 4. The first 4 values are special, and contain GeoKey directory header
   * information. The header values consist of the following information, in order:
   *  Header={KeyDirectoryVersion, KeyRevision, MinorRevision, NumberOfKeys}
   * where:
   *  - "KeyDirectoryVersion" indicates the current version of Key
   * implementation, and will only change if this Tag's Key
   * structure is changed. (Similar to the TIFFVersion (42)).
   * The current DirectoryVersion number is 1. This value will
   * most likely never change, and may be used to ensure that
   * this is a valid Key-implementation.
   *  - "KeyRevision" indicates what revision of Key-Sets are used.
   *  - "MinorRevision" indicates what set of Key-codes are used. The
   * complete revision number is denoted &lt;KeyRevision&gt;.&lt;MinorRevision&gt;
   *  - "NumberOfKeys" indicates how many Keys are defined by the rest of this Tag.
   *
   * This header is immediately followed by a collection of &lt;NumberOfKeys&gt; KeyEntry
   * sets, each of which is also 4-SHORTS long. Each KeyEntry is modeled on the
   * "TIFFEntry" format of the TIFF directory header, and is of the form:
   * KeyEntry = { KeyID, TIFFTagLocation, Count, Value_Offset }
   * where
   *    - "KeyID" gives the key-ID value of the Key (identical in function
   * to TIFF tag ID, but completely independent of TIFF tag-space),
   *    - "TIFFTagLocation" indicates which TIFF tag contains the value(s)
   * of the Key: if TIFFTagLocation is 0, then the value is SHORT,
   * and is contained in the "Value_Offset" entry. Otherwise, the type
   * (format) of the value is implied by the TIFF-Type of the tag
   * containing the value.
   *    - "Count" indicates the number of values in this key.
   *    - "Value_Offset" Value_Offset indicates the index-
   * offset *into* the TagArray indicated by TIFFTagLocation, if
   * it is nonzero. If TIFFTagLocation=0, then Value_Offset
   * contains the actual (SHORT) value of the Key, and
   * Count=1 is implied. Note that the offset is not a byte-offset,
   * but rather an index based on the natural data type of the
   * specified tag array.
   *
   * Following the KeyEntry definitions, the KeyDirectory tag may also contain
   * additional values. For example, if a Key requires multiple SHORT values, they
   * shall be placed at the end of this tag, and the KeyEntry will set
   * TIFFTagLocation=GeoKeyDirectoryTag, with the Value_Offset pointing to the
   * location of the value(s).
   *
   * All key-values which are not of type SHORT are to be stored in one of the following
   * two tags, based on their format:
   */

  /**
   * Tag = 34736 (87BO.H)

   * N = variable
   * Owner: SPOT Image, Inc.
   * This tag is used to store all of the DOUBLE valued GeoKeys, referenced by the
   * [[GeoKeyDirectoryTag]]. The meaning of any value of this double array is determined
   * from the GeoKeyDirectoryTag reference pointing to it.
   * FLOAT values should first be converted to DOUBLE and stored here.
   */
  val GeoDoubleParamsTag: Short = 34736.toShort

  /**
   * This tag is used to store all of the ASCII valued GeoKeys, referenced by the
   * GeoKeyDirectoryTag. Since keys use offsets into tags, any special comments
   * may be placed at the beginning of this tag. For the most part, the only keys
   * that are ASCII valued are "Citation" keys, giving documentation and references
   * for obscure projections, datums, etc.
   * Note on ASCII Keys:
   * Special handling is required for ASCII-valued keys. While it is true that TIFF
   * 6.0 permits multiple NULL-delimited strings within a single ASCII tag, the
   * secondary strings might not appear in the output of naive "tiffdump" programs.
   * For this reason, the null delimiter of each ASCII Key value shall be converted
   * to a "|" (pipe) character before being installed back into the ASCII holding
   * tag, so that a dump of the tag will look like this.
   * AsciiTag="first_value|second_value|etc...last_value|"
   * A baseline GeoTIFF-reader must check for and convert the final "|" pipe character
   * of a key back into a NULL before returning it to the client software.
   * In the TIFF spec it is required that TIFF tags be written out to the file in
   * tag-ID sorted order. This is done to avoid forcing software to perform N-squared
   * sort operations when reading and writing tags.
   * To follow the TIFF philosophy, GeoTIFF-writers shall store the GeoKey entries
   * in key-sorted order within the CoordSystemInfoTag.
   * Example:
   * GeoKeyDirectoryTag=( 1, 1, 2, 6,
   * 1024, 0, 1, 2,
   * 1026, 34737,12, 0,
   * 2048, 0, 1, 32767,
   * 2049, 34737,14, 12,
   * 2050, 0, 1, 6,
   * 2051, 34736, 1, 0 )
   * GeoDoubleParamsTag(34736)=(1.5)
   * GeoAsciiParamsTag(34737)=("Custom File|My Geographic|")
   * The first line indicates that this is a Version 1 GeoTIFF GeoKey directory,
   * the keys are Rev. 1.2, and there are 6 Keys defined in this tag.
   * The next line indicates that the first Key (ID=1024 = GTModelTypeGeoKey) has
   * the value 2 (Geographic), explicitly placed in the entry list (since
   * TIFFTagLocation=0). The next line indicates that the Key 1026 (the
   * GTCitationGeoKey) is listed in the GeoAsciiParamsTag (34737) array, starting
   * at offset 0 (the first in array), and running for 12 bytes and so has the value
   * "Custom File" (the "|" is converted to a null delimiter at the end). Going
   * further down the list, the Key 2051 (GeogLinearUnitSizeGeoKey) is located in
   * the GeoDoubleParamsTag (34736), at offset 0 and has the value 1.5; the value
   * of key 2049 (GeogCitationGeoKey) is "My Geographic".
   * The TIFF layer handles all the problems of data structure, platform independence,
   * format types, etc, by specifying byte-offsets, byte-order format and count,
   * while the Key describes its key values at the TIFF level by specifying Tag
   * number, array-index, and count. Since all TIFF information occurs in TIFF arrays
   * of some sort, we have a robust method for storing anything in a Key that would
   * occur in a Tag.
   * With this Key-value approach, there are 65536 Keys which have all the flexibility
   * of TIFF tag, with the added advantage that a TIFF dump will provide all the
   * information that exists in the GeoTIFF implementation.
   * This GeoKey mechanism will be used extensively in section 2.7, where the numerous
   * parameters for defining Coordinate Systems and their underlying projections
   * are defined.
